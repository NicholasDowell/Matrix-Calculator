# Matrix Calculator :calculator:
#### The completed Matrix calculator will perform calculations on Matrices
#### Functionality will include:
  - Matrix X Matrix multiplication
  - Span of Columns
  - Row Reduction
  - Eigenvalues
  - Least-Squares Problems

## Directory: :blue_book:
- MatrixOperations.py holds all of the current methods for working with Matrices
- Matrix.py is the actual Matrix object, holding the actual 2 dimensional array and its dimensions
- TestSeparateFiles.py is an executable set of tests that check functionality of some methods of the MatrixOperations class
- FirstSteps.py :no_entry_sign: holds some archaic test code from before the "BIG SWITCH". If you run it, then you will get a many errors.

## Next Steps: :boot:
- Update MatrixOperations functions to control incorrectly sized rows and columns
- Get RREF function working. Necessary steps are outlined in the comments in "MatrixOperations" object
- Move Python files on github into a folder for organizational purposes

## Recent Progress:
- Row Scaling is functional :chart_with_upwards_trend:  
  (Please run the TestSeparateFiles code to see a console demonstration)
- Moving all rows of all zeros to bottom is functional! 
- 2 Dimensional Array is working! update any individual value or a whole row! :speech_balloon:
- Row Interchange is functional :fire:
