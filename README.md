# Matrix Calculator
#### The completed Matrix calculator will perform calculations on Matrices
#### Functionality will include:
  - Matrix X Matrix multiplication
  - Span of Columns
  - Row Reduction
  - Eigenvalues
  - Least-Squares Problems

## Next Steps:
- Get RREF function working. Necessary steps are outlined in the comments of "Matrix" object
- Move Python files on github into a folder for organizational purposes

## Recent Progress:
- Row Scaling is functional :chart_with_upwards_trend:  
  (Please run the TestSeparateFiles code to see a console demonstration)
- Moving all rows of all zeros to bottom is functional! 
- 2 Dimensional Array is working! update any individual value or a whole row! :speech_balloon:
- Row Interchange is functional :fire:


## Notes:
- The project mainly focuses on material covered in Foothill's MATH 2B Course (Linear Algebra).
### This includes, but is not limited to:
 - Row Reduced Echelon Form
  - Parametric Descriptions of Solutions
  - Finding Values of variable elements that will create a consistent system
  - Vector Operations
  - Linear Combinations & Span
  - Matrix Equation (Ax = 0) and Solution Sets
  - Vector X Matrix Multiplication
  - Linear Independence
  - Linear Transformations
  - Matrix X Matrix multiplication Multiplication
  - Matrix Transposition
  - Determinants
  - Invertible Matrices
  - Vector Spaces
  - Diagonalization
  - Inner product, Length, Orthogonality (Chapter 6.1)
  - Orthogonal Projections
  - Least-Squares problems
